RAIDZ


raidz1 - similar to RAID 5, allows one disk to fail
raidz2 - similar to RAID 6, allows two disks to fail

raidz3 - Also referred to as RAID 7 allows three disks to fail[1]
  The need for RAID-Z3 arose recently because RAID configurations
  with larger disks (say, 6–10 TB) may take a long time to repair,
  the worst case being weeks.  During those weeks, the rest of
  the disks in the RAID are stressed more because of the
  additional intensive repair process and might subsequently fail,
  too.  By using RAID-Z3, the risk involved with disk replacement
  is reduced.[2]

In addition to handling whole-disk failures, RAID-Z can also
detect and correct silent data corruption, offering "self-healing
data": when reading a RAID-Z block, ZFS compares it against its
checksum, and if the data disks did not return the right answer,
ZFS reads the parity and then figures out which disk returned bad
data.  Then, it repairs the damaged data and returns good data to
the requestor.[2]

RAID Z is the ZFS parity raid mechanism, with Z2 and Z3
referring to dual and triple parity, respectively. Parity
has repercussions both in terms of fault tolerance and
performance.  Parity generation has a performance cost
as well as resource demand (each parity member requires
a disk and a host bus channel) so generally should be
accounted for in terms of sensitivity to downtime (each
additional parity bit results in an additional disk that
can be lost without affecting data availability) within
the requirements for usable space and available
mechanical resources.

Add to that the fact that data is written and read in
blocks in binary arrangement, leading to the need to
align data to powers of two.  Since RAID stripes consist
of a number of data blocks for each (set of) parity
block(s), optimal RAID arrangements necessarily follow
powers of two for maximum efficiency.  Since one parity
block for 2 drives is very costly in terms of hardware,
optimal RAID configuration therefore follow in 4s-
1 parity disk per 4 data stripes.  This provides the
most commonly optimal arrangement of aligned stripes
with sufficient fault tolerance.  So double parity (Z2)
would be optimally applied to 10 disk RAIDsets, and
triple parity (Z3) for 15 disk RAIDsets. 

Above 15 you'd want to split your data into separate
raidsets, or create compound (nested) RAID arrangements;
on occasion it may makes sense to double up if the
application is not sensitive to the greater exposure to fault- 
eg 9 disks for a Z1, 18 for a Z2, 27 for Z3.
