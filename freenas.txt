FreeNAS


FreeNAS is a free and open-source network-attached storage (NAS)
software based on FreeBSD and the OpenZFS file system.  It is
licensed under the terms of the BSD License and runs on commodity
x86-64 hardware.

FreeNAS is a Free and Open Source Network Attached Storage (NAS)
software appliance.  This means that you can use FreeNAS to share
data over file-based sharing protocols, including CIFS for Windows
users, NFS for Unix-like operating systems, and AFP for Mac OS X
users.  FreeNAS uses the ZFS file system to store, manage, and
protect data.  ZFS provides advanced features like snapshots to
keep old versions of files, incremental remote backups to keep
your data safe on another device without huge file transfers, and
intelligent compression, which reduces the size of files so
quickly and efficiently that it actually helps transfers happen
faster.

Can FreeNAS be used as a Media Server?
======================================
It sure can! FreeNAS includes support for a wide variety of third-party
software plugins, including Plex Media Server.  Plex Media Server allows
FreeNAS to stream television shows, movies, and music to a wide variety
of devices.  If you’re concerned about system requirements, the FreeNAS
Mini Storage Device from iXsystems has enough power to support 1080p
HD video and still run normal FreeNAS operations.

Required memory
===============
The general rule of thumb here is to have 5 GB of memory for every 1TB of
deduplicated data.  That said, there may be instances where more is required,
but you will need to plan to meet the maximum potential memory requirements to
avoid problems down the road.  To get a more precise estimate of the required
memory for deduplication do the following: run the 'zdb -b (pool name)'
command for the desired pool to get an idea of the number of blocks required,
then multiply the 'bp count' by 320 bytes to get your required memory.  If
it's less than 5GB, still use the 5GB per terabyte of storage rule.  If it's
higher, go with that number per terabyte.

For 24TB:
  5x 24 = 120GB

For 48TB:
  5x 48 = 240GB

Crucial MX200 SSD Review (500GB/1TB)
"Based upon the rating on the MX200s' stickers, the max power consumption is
rated for up to 8.5W. In testing we found they were able to stay well under
this value. Max draw was under 5W.  At idle they consumed very little power
at 60 and 65 milliwatts respectfully.  This is very good for those who plan
on putting this SSD in a laptop, Ultrabook, or tablet."

The 'Hidden' Cost of Using ZFS for Your Home NAS
January 02, 2016
http://louwrentius.com/the-hidden-cost-of-using-zfs-for-your-home-nas.html#fn:san

Supermicro 2U SuperChassis 216
These 24x 2.5" SAS3/SATA hard drive chassis rock hard.
Would need to determine the correct power rating for:
1TB Crucial MX200 ($307.77) <=== $288 on newegg
1TB Crucial MX300 ($249.99)
Given the MX200's use a max of 8.5W then 
24x8.5W = 204W
Hence the 920W would be ample.
