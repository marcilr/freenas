Hardware


cpu - Intel
  FreeNAS is based on FreeBSD.  FreeBSD has a long history of
  working better on Intel than AMD.

ram - ECC RAM
  The general rule of thumb here is to have 5 GB of memory
  for every 1TB of deduplicated data.  That said, there may
  be instances where more is required, but you will need to
  plan to meet the maximum potential memory requirements to
  avoid problems down the road.  To get a more precise
  estimate of the required memory for deduplication do the
  following: run the 'zdb -b (pool name); command for the
  desired pool to get an idea of the number of blocks
  required, then multiply the 'bp count' by 320 bytes to
  get your required memory. If it's less than 5GB, still
  use the 5GB per terabyte of storage rule. If it's higher,
  go with that number per terabyte.

controller - LSI is the best game in town for add-on
  storage controllers. LSI 12Gbps parts such as the 9300.
  The newer 12Gbps parts use version 5 of the LSI driver.
  Cards using this driver should use version 5 of the firmware.

nic - gigE Intel NICs are the best game in town for Gigabit
  networking with FreeNAS.  In the Ten Gigabit arena,
  Chelsio NICs are hands down the best choice for FreeNAS.
