Storage Controllers


LSI is the best game in town for add-on storage controllers.
Avoid their MegaRAID solutions and stick with their HBAs.
You'll see three generations of HBAs commonly available today.
The oldest (and slowest) are the SAS 2008 based I/O controllers
such as the 9211 or the very popular IBM M1015.  The next
generation of these controllers was based on the 2308 which
added PCI 3.0 support and increased CPU horsepower on the
controller itself.  An example here is the 9207.  Both the
2008 and 2308 based solutions are 6Gbps SAS parts.  The
newest generation of controllers are 12Gbps parts such as the
9300.  The FreeNAS driver for the 6 Gbps parts is based on
version 16 of the stock LSI driver with many enhancements that
LSI never incorporated into their driver.  In addition, many of
the changes after version 16 were specifically targeted at the
Integrated RAID functionality that can be flashed onto these
cards.  As a result, "upgrading" the driver manually to the
newer versions found on the LSI website can actually result in
downgrading its reliability or performance.  I highly recommend
running version 16 firmware on these cards.  It's the
configuration tested by LSI, and it's the configuration tested
by the FreeNAS developers.  Running newer firmware should
work, however running older firmware is not recommended or
supported as there are known flaws that can occur by running
the FreeNAS driver against a controller with an older firmware.
FreeNAS will warn you if the firmware on an HBA is incompatible
with the driver.  Heed this warning or data loss can occur.
The newer 12Gbps parts use version 5 of the LSI driver.
Cards using this driver should use version 5 of the firmware.
