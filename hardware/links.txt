Flashing IT Firmware to the LSI SAS9211-8i HBA
Feb 4th, 2012
In the process of upgrading my storage server, I wanted to upgrade the firmware
on my recently acquired LSI SAS9211-8i SAS/SATA 6Gb/s PCI Express card to the
latest IT version rather than the IR version it ships with.

IBM ServeRAID M1015 compatibility

o Read this: http://www.servethehome.com/ibm-m1015-part-1-started-lsi-92208i/
  Note: it's a 4 part series, flashing is covered in part 4.
  That's a great card and a cheap way to get yourself an LSI 2008 chip based controller.
price: $112.99 (amazon - June 1, 2017)

IBM ServeRAID M1015 Part 4: Cross flashing to a LSI9211-8i in IT or IR mode
By Pieter - January 7, 2012105
One of the most popular SAS 6.0gbps/ SATA III controllers for enthusiasts is
the IBM M1015.  In its native form, it is a very capable host bus adapter (HBA)
based on the LSI SAS2008 chip.
