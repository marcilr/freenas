ECC RAM



ECC RAM or Not?
===============
This is probably the most contested issue surrounding ZFS
(the filesystem that FreeNAS uses to store your data) today.
I've run ZFS with ECC RAM and I've run it without.  I've
been involved in the FreeNAS community for many years and
have seen people argue that ECC is required and others
argue that it is a pointless waste of money.  ZFS does
something no other filesystem you'll have available to
you does: it checksums your data, and it checksums the
metadata used by ZFS, and it checksums the checksums.  If
your data is corrupted in memory before it is written,
ZFS will happily write (and checksum) the corrupted data.
Additionally, ZFS has no pre-mount consistency checker or
tool that can repair filesystem damage.  This is very nice
when dealing with large storage arrays as a 64TB pool can
be mounted in seconds, even after a bad shutdown.  However
if a non-ECC memory module goes haywire, it can cause
irreparable damage to your ZFS pool that can cause complete
loss of the storage.  For this reason, I highly recommend
the use of ECC RAM with "mission-critical" ZFS.  Systems
with ECC RAM will correct single bit errors on the fly,
and will halt the system before they can do any damage to
the array if multiple bit errors are detected.  If it's
imperative that your ZFS based system must always be
available, ECC RAM is a requirement.  If it's only some
level of annoying (slightly, moderately that you need to
restore your ZFS system from backups, non-ECC RAM will fit
the bill.
