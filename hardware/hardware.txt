Hardware


cpu - Intel
  FreeNAS is based on FreeBSD. FreeBSD has a long history of working better on Intel than AMD.

ram - ECC RAM
  The general rule of thumb here is to have 5 GB of memory for every 1TB of deduplicated data.
  That said, there may be instances where more is required, but you will need to plan to meet
  the maximum potential memory requirements to avoid problems down the road.  To get a more
  precise estimate of the required memory for deduplication do the following: run the 
  'zdb -b (pool name); command for the desired pool to get an idea of the number of blocks
  required, then multiply the 'bp count' by 320 bytes to get your required memory. If it's
  less than 5GB, still use the 5GB per terabyte of storage rule. If it's higher, go with that
  number per terabyte.

controller - LSI is the best game in town for add-on storage controllers.
  LSI 12Gbps parts such as the 9300.  The newer 12Gbps parts use version 5 of the LSI driver.
  Cards using this driver should use version 5 of the firmware.

nic - Intel NICs are the best game in town for Gigabit networking with FreeNAS.
