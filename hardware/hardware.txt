Hardware


ram - ECC RAM
  The general rule of thumb here is to have 5 GB of memory for every 1TB of deduplicated data.
  That said, there may be instances where more is required, but you will need to plan to meet
  the maximum potential memory requirements to avoid problems down the road.  To get a more
  precise estimate of the required memory for deduplication do the following: run the 
  'zdb -b (pool name); command for the desired pool to get an idea of the number of blocks
  required, then multiply the 'bp count' by 320 bytes to get your required memory. If it's
  less than 5GB, still use the 5GB per terabyte of storage rule. If it's higher, go with that
  number per terabyte.
