ram
===
The X11SSL-CF/-nF motherboard supports up to 64GB of
unbuffered (UDIMM) DDR4 ECC 2400/2133/1866/1600/1333MHz memory
in four memory slots. Populating these DIMM slots with memory
modules of the same type and size will result in interleaved
memory, which will improve memory performance.
MNL-1782.pdf, p. 31

Test memory includes:
  DDR4 1.2V 2133 ECC
  DDR4 1.2V-2400 ECC   <===

Motherboard
===========
X11SSL-CF                                                       <===
The Skylake equivalent of the X10SL7-F, the X11SSL-cF takes the
X11SSL-F’s feature set and adds an LSI/Avago SAS 3008 SAS3
controller, for a total of 14 direct-attach drives.
With its 64GB RAM limit, it is a natural choice for those servers
that would be limited by the X10SL7-F’s 32GB RAM limit.
1. Single socket H4 (LGA 1151) supports Intel Xeon
   processor E3-1200 v6/v5, Intel 7th/6th Gen. Core i3 series,
   Intel Celeron and Intel Pentium
2. Intel C232 chipset
3. Up to 64GB Unbuffered ECC UDIMM DDR4 2400MHz; 4 DIMM slots
4. Expansion slots: 
   1 PCI-E 3.0 x8 (in x16), 
   1 PCI-E 3.0 x4 (in x8),
   1 PCI-E 3.0 x1
5. Dual GbE LAN with Intel i210-AT
6. 6 SATA3 (6Gbps) via C232; RAID 0, 1, 5, 10
7. 8 SAS3 (12Gbps) via Broadcom 3008 SW controller; RAID 0, 1, 10
8. I/O: 1 VGA, 2 COM, TPM header
9. 2 SuperDOM with built-in power
10. 5 USB 3.0 (2 rear, 2 via header(s), 1 Type A), 
    6 USB 2.0 (2 rear, 4 via header(s))

"The general rule of thumb here is to have 5 GB of memory for every 1TB
of deduplicated data.  That said, there may be instances where more is
required, but you will need to plan to meet the maximum potential memory
requirements to avoid problems down the road."

raid levels
===========
RAIDZ1 (raid5) - only 1 drive redundancy
RAIDZ2 (raid6) - 2 drive redundancy
RAIDZ3 (raid7) - 3 drive redundancy
