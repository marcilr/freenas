Gigabit Ethernet
================
For Gigabit Ethernet, the recommendation is simple: Intel.
Any Intel 1GbE controller will work fine.

Intel I217/I218/I219-series
---------------------------
The I217/218/219 series of NICs is actually just a PHY for the gigabit
Ethernet hardware present in the PCH.  These are basic adapters that
will be fine for most users but lack certain features that may be useful
in more complex environments. Note that -V models are not officially
supported under FreeBSD (and thus FreeNAS), whereas the -LM models are
officially supported.

Intel I210
----------
The I210 NIC is a very popular model, close to a standalone I217 with
some additional features (notably the ability to be multiplexed between
host and BMC).

Intel I350
----------
The I350 NIC is Intelâ€™s high-end GbE model and supports high-end
features such as Virtual Machine Device Queues (VMDq) and
Single-Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV). It is available in
both two- and four-port models.
