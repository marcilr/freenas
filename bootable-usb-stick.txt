Bootable FreeNAS usb stick


The goal for the 2x Supermicro 2U X8DTU-F is to install 
FreeNAS on a bootlable usb stick.


Note: FreeNAS will only install to 64-bit hardware and the
      installer will not work on 32-bit hardware.

On FreeBSD or Linux
===================
On a FreeBSD or Linux system, the dd command can be used to
write the .iso file to an inserted USB thumb drive or compact
flash device.  Example 2.2a demonstrates writing the image to
the first USB device (/dev/da0) on a FreeBSD system.
Substitute the filename of your .iso file and the device name
representing the device to write to on your system.

Warning The dd command is very powerful and can destroy any
existing data on the specified device.  Be very sure that you
know the device name to write to and that you do not typo the
device name when using dd!  If you are uncomfortable using
this command, write the .iso file to a CD instead.

Writing the .iso file to a USB Thumb Drive:
  dd if=FreeNAS-9.3-RELEASE-x64.iso of=/dev/da0 bs=64k
  6117+0 records in
  6117+0 records out
  400883712 bytes transferred in 88.706398 secs (4519220 bytes/sec)

When using the dd command:
  if= refers to the input file, or the name of the file to write to
      the device.

  of= refers to the output file; in our case, the device name of
      the flash card or removable USB drive. You may have to
      increment the number in the name if it is not the first USB
      device.  On Linux, use /dev/sdX, where X refers to the letter
      of the USB device.

  bs= refers to the block size
