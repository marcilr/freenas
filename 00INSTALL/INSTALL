Installing FreeNAS


What do I need to get started with FreeNAS?
To use FreeNAS, you’ll need standard PC hardware with a 64-bit processor
and at least 8GB of RAM.  FreeNAS is intended to be installed on USB
Flash drive, with a recommended minimum size of 8GB.  16GB provides more
room for boot environments.  FreeNAS supports installation from a burned
CD or by directly burning to the flash drive.  Boot from the installed
drive and in most networks you will automatically be provided with an
IP address.  Point your web browser at the IP address of the FreeNAS
system and you’re good to go!  Read the FreeNAS Documentation[1] for more
information.

1. Getting FreeNAS
   The latest STABLE version of FreeNAS 9.3 can be downloaded from:
     http://download.freenas.org/

   NOTE: FreeNAS will only install to 64-bit hardware and the installer
   will not work on 32-bit hardware.

   The download page contains the following types of files:

   o .iso: this is a bootable installer that can be written to
     either a CD or USB flash as described in Preparing the Media.

   o .GUI_Upgrade.txz: this is a compressed firmware upgrade image.
     If your intent is to upgrade FreeNAS, download this file and
     see the section on Upgrading.

   Each file has an associated sha256.txt file which should be used
   to verify the integrity of the downloaded file.  The command you
   use to verify the checksum varies by operating system:

   o on a BSD system use the command sha256 name_of_file
   o on a Linux system use the command sha256sum name_of_file
   o on a Mac system use the command shasum -a 256 name_of_file
   o on a Windows or Mac system, you can also install a utility
     such as HashCalc or HashTab

   The value produced by running the command should match the value
   of the sha256.txt file.

2. Preparing the Media
   Beginning with version 9.3, FreeNAS must be installed using a
   menu-driven installer, as the ZFS boot partition is created
   during the installation.  To perform an installation, download
   the .iso file and write it to either a CD or a USB stick.

   To burn the .iso file to CD, use a CD burning utility.

   The command which is used to burn the .iso file to a compact
   flash card or USB thumbdrive depends upon the operating system.
   This section demonstrates utilities for several operating
   systems.

   Note: if you will be burning the installation file to a USB stick,
   you will need two USB slots, each with an inserted USB device,
   where one USB stick contains the installer and the other USB stick
   is selected to install into.  When performing the installation, be
   sure to select the correct USB device to install to.  In other
   words, you can not install FreeNAS into the same USB stick that
   you boot the installer from.   After installation, remove the USB
   stick containing the installer, and if necessary, configure the
   BIOS to boot from the remaining USB stick.

   Once you have written the .iso file to the installation media,
   make sure the boot order in the BIOS is set to boot from that
   device and boot the system to start the installation.

3. On FreeBSD or Linux
   On a FreeBSD or Linux system, the dd command can be used to write
   the .iso file to an inserted USB thumb drive or compact flash
   device.  Example 2.2a demonstrates writing the image to the first
   USB device (/dev/da0) on a FreeBSD system.  Substitute the
   filename of your .iso file and the device name representing the
   device to write to on your system.

   Warning: The dd command is very powerful and can destroy any
   existing data on the specified device. Be very sure that you know
   the device name to write to and that you do not typo the device
   name when using dd! If you are uncomfortable using this command,
   write the .iso file to a CD instead.

   Example 2.2a: Writing the .iso file to a USB Thumb Drive

     dd if=FreeNAS-9.3-RELEASE-x64.iso of=/dev/da0 bs=64k
     6117+0 records in
     6117+0 records out
     400883712 bytes transferred in 88.706398 secs (4519220 bytes/sec)

   When using the dd command:
   o if= refers to the input file, or the name of the file to write
     to the device.

   o of= refers to the output file; in our case, the device name of
     the flash card or removable USB drive.  You may have to increment
     the number in the name if it is not the first USB device.  On
     Linux, use /dev/sdX, where X refers to the letter of the USB device.

   o bs= refers to the block size

3. Performing the Installation
   With the installation media inserted, boot the system.  This should
   load the FreeNAS installation’s GRUB menu...
