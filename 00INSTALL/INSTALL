Installing FreeNAS


1. Get latest STABLE version of FreeNAS 9.3 can be downloaded from:
   http://download.freenas.org/.

   NOTE: FreeNAS will only install to 64-bit hardware and the installer
   will not work on 32-bit hardware.

   The download page contains the following types of files:

   o .iso: this is a bootable installer that can be written to
     either a CD or USB flash as described in Preparing the Media.

   o .GUI_Upgrade.txz: this is a compressed firmware upgrade image.
     If your intent is to upgrade FreeNAS, download this file and
     see the section on Upgrading.

   Each file has an associated sha256.txt file which should be used
   to verify the integrity of the downloaded file.  The command you
   use to verify the checksum varies by operating system:

   o on a BSD system use the command sha256 name_of_file
   o on a Linux system use the command sha256sum name_of_file
   o on a Mac system use the command shasum -a 256 name_of_file
   o on a Windows or Mac system, you can also install a utility
     such as HashCalc or HashTab

   The value produced by running the command should match the value
   of the sha256.txt file.
